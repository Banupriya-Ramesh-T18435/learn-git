Syncing your forked repository to the original repository is an important step before submitting any pull request to the original repository for the changes in your forked repository. Even if you are not going to submit a pull request to the original repository, there are times that you want the additional features and/or bug fixes that have been done since you forked the original repository.

You could do a pull request but this adds an additional commit into your forked repository instead of making your forked repository match the original repository. In order to sync the forked repository without adding any additional commits as part of the process you need to configure the original repository as an upstream remote, merge in the changes from the original repository and then push the merged version back to Github.
